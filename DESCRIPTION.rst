Fast Twilio SMS message response API
------------------------------------

``pyrowire`` is an API that handles all of the plumbing necessary to create an SMS message response project with Twilio.
After installing ``pyrowire``, all you have to do is decide what you want to do with the data that comes in to your
web server. We've got the rest covered.

1-minute Installation & Setup
-----------------------------

``pyrowire`` can be installed and initialized via pip, and is best used with virtualenv. From the root directory of your project, run:

::

    pip install pyrowire && pyrowire-init

| This will install ``pyrowire``, and copy into the root folder the following files:

* `my\_app.py <https://github.com/wieden-kennedy/pyrowire/blob/master/pyrowire/resources/sample/my_app.py>`_ (the application file)
* `my\_settings.py <https://github.com/wieden-kennedy/pyrowire/blob/master/pyrowire/resources/sample/my_settings.py>`_ (the configuration file)
* `Procfile <https://github.com/wieden-kennedy/pyrowire/blob/master/pyrowire/resources/sample/Procfile>`_ (a Heroku Procfile)
* `requirements.txt <https://github.com/wieden-kennedy/pyrowire/blob/master/pyrowire/resources/sample/requirements.txt>`_ (pip requirements file)

Usage
-----
::

  ENV=(DEV|STAGING|PROD) [RUN=(web|worker)] python my_app.py

Sample Application
------------------
Here's what the sample app (from running ``pyrowire-init``) looks like:

.. code-block:: python

    import pyrowire
    import my_settings

    # configure the pyrowire application
    pyrowire.configure(settings=my_settings)

    # all app.handler methods need to be annotated with the topic for which they process
    # and take one kwarg, 'message_data'
    @pyrowire.handler(topic='my_topic')
    def my_handler(message_data=None):
        pass

    # all app.validator methods need to be annotated with the name of the validator
    # and take one kwarg, 'message_data'
    @pyrowire.validator(name='my_validator')
    def my_validator(message_data=None):
        pass

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        pyrowire.run()

As you can see, it's rather straightforward; to start out you are given placeholders for both a handler and a validator.
The handler is where you will write the business logic for your Twilio application. One or more validators can be
added if needed, or removed altogether. See their respective sections below for more information.

Once you've run the install and setup, there are three steps to configuring your app:

1. Implement a handler (required)
2. Add any additional validators for incoming messages (optional)
3. Set up the config file

Handlers
--------
With ``pyrowire``, the only logic you need to think about (other than optional message validators), is your handler:
what happens to the message that comes in after it's been successfully received.

A handler is just a function that define the business logic for your application, and is annotated
``@pyrowire.handler(topic='some_topic')``, where 'some_topic' corresponds to a defined topic
block in your settings file. Let's take a look at a very simple handler, that just receives an
incoming message, randomizes the order, then saves it:

.. code-block:: python

    # all app.handler methods need to be annotated with the topic for which they process
    # and take one kwarg, 'message_data'
    @pyrowire.handler(topic='sms_randomizer')
    def my_handler(message_data=None):
        import random
        # randomize the message and save it as 'return_message'
        message = message_data['message'].split()
        random.shuffle(message)
        message_data['return_message'] = ' '.join(message)

        # send the message data back along with the key of the message body
        # to send to initiate a Twilio SMS reply
        pyrowire.sms(data=message_data, key='return_message')

As you can see, all we need to do to process and return a message is tell a method annotated with
``@pyro.handler``(topic='my_topic_name')`` what to do with the message data that is received from the pyrowire app
worker, then send it using ``pyro.sms`` method. To use this method, we pass both the message_data dict object,
as well as the key we want ``pyrowire`` to use to return a message to its sender.

Message Validators
------------------
``pyrowire`` has three default message validators:

- **profanity**: checks the incoming message against a list of about 1,000 graphically profane terms (trust us).
- **length**: checks that the length of the incoming message does not exceed some threshold; Twilio, by default, uses 160 characters as a limit, so we do too. Also ensures incoming messages have a length > 0.
- **parseable**: Twilio can't parse everything. Take emoji for example. The default parseable validator allows inclusion of all alphanumeric characters and most punctuation characters (the ones people actually use in writing, at any rate).

You can define additional validator functions easily:

1. In your app file, use the ``@pyrowire.validator`` annotation to designate a validator as something that a message needs to be validated against.
2. Add it to your `settings <#settings-configuration>`__ as a key/value pair ('name_of_validator': 'failure_message') for the topic that requires that validator.

Let's check it out by creating, say, a validator that requires the word 'yo' be present in all messages:

.. code-block:: python

    # all app.validator methods need to be annotated with the name of the validator
    # and take one kwarg, 'message_data'
    @pyrowire.validator(name='must_include_yo')
    def must_include_yo(message_data=None):
        import re.search
        return not re.search(r'*yo*', message_data['message'].lower())

Overriding Validators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Say you don't care about profanity. It happens. Say you want to override the default profanity validator, to make it
non-existentâ€”just remove it from your configuration file for the application in question
(see `Applications <#applications>`__ for more info on removing default validators).
If you want to change the validator's behavior, just define it again:

.. code-block:: python

    # profanity validator that considers 'reaver' to be the only bad word in the verse
    @pyrowire.validator
    def profanity(message_data=None):
        import re.search
        return re.search(r'\breaver\b', message_data['message'].lower())

Settings Configuration
----------------------
Once you've got your validators and handlers set up, you'll need to dial in your config file. ``pyrowire`` uses a python file for settings configuration.
for its configuration files. To check out the sample settings file, look
`here <https://github.com/wieden-kennedy/pyrowire/blob/master/pyrowire/resources/sample/my_settings.py>`_. pyrowire's configuration files are broken down into two sections:

- **Applications** (Twilio application-specific settings). There can be as many of these blocks as needed.
- **Profiles** (environment profile-specific settings). There is one block per run environment *(DEV/STAGING/PROD)*

Applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here's what the application section of a ``pyrowire`` config file looks like:

.. code-block:: python

    APPLICATIONS = {
        'my_topic': {
            # send_on_accept determines whether to send an additional accept/success message upon successfully
            # receiving an SMS. NOTE: this will result in two return messages per inbound message
            'send_on_accept': False,
            # global accept (success) and error messages for your app
            'accept_response': 'Great, we\'ll get right back to you.',
            'error_response': 'It seems like an error has occurred...please try again later.',
            # key/value pairs for application-specific validators and their responses if a message fails to pass validation.
            # Define your custom validators here. If you wish to change the response message of a default validator,
            # you can do that here.
            'validators': {
                'profanity': 'You kiss your mother with that mouth? No profanity, please.',
                'length': 'Your message exceeded the maximum allowable character limit (or was empty). Please try again .',
                'parseable': 'Please only use alphanumeric and punctuation characters.'
            },
            # properties are any non-pyrowire-specific properties that you will need to
            # run your handler, such as an API key to some external service.
            'properties': {},
            # Twilio account credentials section, where the account credentials for your
            # application-specific account are stored
            'twilio': {
                'account_sid': '',
                'auth_token': '',
                'from_number': '+1234567890'
            },
            # the default max length for a single message segment, per twilio, is 160 chars
            # but you can set this anything under 1600.
            'max_message_length': 160
        }
    }

Profiles
~~~~~~~~

Profiles are what ``pyrowire`` uses to determine environment-specific details such as debug, Redis host, and web host.
This is what the default ``dev`` profile looks like:

.. code-block:: python

    PROFILES = {
        # the environment name ('dev', 'staging', or 'prod')
        'dev': {
            # debug/logging settings
            'debug': True,
            'log_level': logging.DEBUG,
            # the connection details for your redis store
            'redis': {
                'host': 'localhost',
                'port': 6379,
                'db': 0,
                'password': ''
            },
            # host and port information
            # if running on Heroku, use the following settings:
            #    'host': '0.0.0.0'
            #    'port': 0
            'host': 'localhost',
            'port': 5000
        }

Heroku-specific host settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Of note is that for Heroku deployment, you will want to set the port to ``0``, which tells ``pyrowire`` to set the port
to the value of the Heroku web container's $PORT env var. Additionally, it is a good idea to set the host for any Heroku
deployments to ``0.0.0.0`` so that ``pyrowire`` will listen on all bindings to that web container.


Environment vars
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``pyrowire`` requires one environment var to be present when running locally:

- **ENV**: the run profile (DEV\|STAGING\|PROD) under which you want to run ``pyrowire``

For running on Heroku, there are two additional environment vars required:

- **RUN**: (web\|worker), the type of Heroku dyno you are running. 
- **TOPIC**: only required for workers, this is the topic the specific worker should be working for.

See the **Heroku Procfile** (below) for more details.

Standalone/Dev
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have your handler, optional additional validator(s), and configuration all set up, running ``pyrowire`` is easy:

::

    ENV=DEV python my_app.py

This will spin up a worker for your topic(s), and a web server running on localhost:5000 to handle incoming messages.
After that, you can start sending it GET/POST requests using your tool of choice. You won't be able to use Twilio for
inbound messages yet, (unless your local DNS name is published to the world) but you should receive them back from requests made locally.

Heroku
~~~~~~

Right, so. When you are ready to move to staging or production, it's time to get the app up into Heroku. Remember, the
host setting should be ``0.0.0.0`` and the port setting for your profile should be ``0`` when deploying to Heroku.
We won't get deep into how to deploy to Heroku here, since it isn't really in the scope of this document, but the basics
are:

#. Set up a Heroku application with at least one web dyno and at least one worker
#. Set up a Redis database on an external server, through a service, or as an add-on
#. Add the Redis host, port, database, and password information to your config file for Staging and/or Production profiles.
#. Add the heroku remote git endpoint to your project (``git remote add heroku.com:my-heroku-app.git``)
#. Push the project up to heroku and let it spin up.
#. Add the remote endpoint to your Twilio account number (e.g., for SMS: ``http://my-heroku-app.herokuapp.com/queue/my_topic``)
#. Profit.

Heroku Procfile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you ran ``pyrowire-init`` a sample Procfile was placed in the root of your application folder.
Taking a look at it, you can see:

::

    web: ENV=STAGING RUN=web python ./my_app.py --server run_gunicorn 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers=1
    worker: ENV=STAGING RUN=worker TOPIC=my_topic python ./my_app.py

You will need to include a ``RUN`` environment var set to either ``web`` or ``worker`` with respect to
the purpose of the command item.

For workers, you will additionally need to include a ``TOPIC`` environment var to indicate which topic the worker(s)
should work for. You can see in the ``web`` line, the default setting in the Procfile is one worker. Scale as needed.
