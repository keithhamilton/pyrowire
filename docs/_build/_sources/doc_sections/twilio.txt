Twilio, Twilio, Twilio
======================

What is Twilio?
---------------
Twilio is a managed service layer that allows programmers to build powerful voice and SMS applications.

What parts of Twilio does pyrowire use?
---------------------------------------
Currently pyrowire uses the TwiML and REST APIs to facilitate building applications for SMS & MMS. We have voice support
in the roadmap, but it is not being included in the initial release.

How much does it cost?
----------------------
It is fairly cheap, depending on the volume of traffic you expect to see. Check out their `pricing guide <https://www.twilio.com/pricing>`_ for more information.

Test accounts
-------------
You can set up a test account for free. This is a great way to test out your applications without paying. There are
limitations on your test account, however, such as a canned message prepended to any SMS messages that go through your account.
